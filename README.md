# Pothole-Detection-using-CNNs-and-Transfer-Learning
Building and saving a TensorFlow model that can detect potholes on roads


This project involves building a CNN using transfer learning from the mobilenet classification model. This model was trained on a total of 1040 training images and  259 validation images.
